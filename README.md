# AngleGuard (Do not use this project!)

This repository contains the cleaned and deobfuscated source code of [AngleGuard](https://builtbybit.com/resources/angleguard-anti-cw-anti-auto-totem.45856/).

> [!CAUTION]
> The obfuscated jar was obtained directly from the original author through Discord, and not through any unauthorized or illegal channels such as BuiltByBit. This ensures that no terms of service or intellectual property rights have been violated.
> I personally deobfuscated the application, cleaned up the code, and formatted it for better readability, as the original source was heavily obfuscated.

## What should I use instead?
For a reliable anti-totem solution, consider using [TotemGuard](https://github.com/Bram1903/TotemGuard) instead.
